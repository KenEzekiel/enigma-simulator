## Project Description

This project is a GUI Program of the enigma simulator, made in python. The enigma is a cryptographic machine used by Nazi Germany in World War II. This machine uses substitution and transposition encryption to encrypt the plaintext to ciphertext. As the enigma machine can be set to many configurations, it was nearly impossible to crack the machine, while allies can easily decrypt this symmetric encryption with the same configuration. But in 1939, Alan Turing developed the Bombe to crack the enigma machine and it worked wonderfully.

This project is made for the purpose of fulfilling The IRK Lab Selection Task, made by Kenneth Ezekiel (13521089).
